## Overview

Quick Ship is a delivery sign-up form project that prioritizes user validation. Although no data is collected, the form incorporates robust input validations to ensure that users provide accurate and appropriately formatted information during the process.

## Features

* **First Name and Last Name** - Simple text input fields for users to enter their first and last names. These fields are required to proceed, ensuring that basic identification information is provided.

* **Email Address** - Utilizes the email input type with a regex pattern for a valid email address format. This helps prevent incorrect email entries and ensures the submission of a properly formatted email.

* **Password** - Password input with specified criteria: at least one digit, one lowercase and one uppercase letter, and a minimum length of 8 characters. Users receive real-time feedback on password strength and requirements.

* **Phone Number** - Phone number input type with a regex pattern for a specific format (+639xxxxxxxxx). This ensures the correct input format for phone numbers and provides clarity to users.

* **Confirm Password** - A password confirmation field that dynamically checks if it matches the original password input. This helps prevent errors in password entry and ensures data consistency.

## Tools

* Visual Studio Code
* Gitbash terminal
